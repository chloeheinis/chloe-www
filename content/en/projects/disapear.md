Raising awareness of climate change is a major challenge, which we tried to raise during the exhibition 'disappear here' organized by the HEAR (Haute Ã©cole des arts du Rhin). It is through a series of objects changing over time that the viewer is invited to question his relationship to the environment.

In collaboration with Lina Kahal and Jonathan Kleinpeter
